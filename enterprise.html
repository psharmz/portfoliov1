            <p> I found there are many ways in how designing for professional use applications is different than designing consumer facing applications. Here are some key insights: 
            </p>

            <h2> Less Flashy More Functional </h2>


            <p> They have to use your product whether they like it or not. Period. They have to do their job. Because of this, there is more emphasis put on being able to complete tasks efficiently and accurately rather than the visual design. 
            </p>

    
            <h2> Transparency is Key </h2>

            <p> As a solo designer with very little guidance. I have made mistakes and have had things backfired. For this project, I originally designed each portal to be different for each end user group. I realized that while they do have different roles and responsibilities, the user groups in enterprise tend to be very cross-functional and need to talk to one another. There was a strong desire from the business to have more transparency and consistency for this reason. A redesign then focused on making the portals for the different groups look more alike, but highlighting relevant information for each group specifically. 
            </p>

            <h2> Customization vs. Automation </h2>

            <p> If you want to automate a process, it means you have to standardize it. This is where you have to work very closely with your business analyst or product manager to make sure the business needs and future business processes are solidified. There were times where instead of standardizing I was asked to make certain features customizable. For example, if the roles for each of the user groups were more solidified, each table would be fiiltered be default. Because no standardization could be decided on, a customized filter widget was built. One major pain point for end users was having to reset filters every time they visited the dashboard. To accomodate the user needs and satisfy the business needs, a ‘saved filter’ widget was design was proposed and built.
