          <h2 class="col-xs-12"> Project Background </h2>
          <p class="col-xs-12"> LivCollege is a service that pairs prospective college students with current college students for a personalized campus visit experience. I was brought on the team as project lead and got to work closely with four designers. As a team, we elicited requirements, created a brand identity, and designed a high-fidelity prototype of the web application. Working on this particular project taught me how to deal with changing requirements. Because we designed the web app for prospective students, host students, and university administrators, I also learned how to create user experiences for applications that have many different type of users.</p>

          <p class="col-xs-12"> By involving stakeholders early in the process, we became aware that our client had not solidified a business model, hence finalizing wireframes was difficult. We dealt with this challenge by solidifying a minimal viable product in a brainstorm session with our client. We also met with Northeastern University admissions and showed them our initial wireframes to gather feedback. By brainstorming all possible requirements and narrowing it down to the essential ones for our MVP, we were able to solidify a set of business requirements and use cases. </p>
          <h2 class="col-xs-12"> Paper Prototyping and Wireframing </h2>
          <p class="col-xs-12"> We went through many rounds of paper prototyping and wireframing before we finalized the UI. Once we had solidified the use cases our client wanted in the MVP, the process was a lot smoother. The biggest challenge in this phase was designing different portals for the prospective student, host student, and University Administration. Each of these portals needed a UI design that not only reflected the use cases for that user, but also tied seamlessly for interactions with other user types. </p>

          <div class="product-pics-wrapper">

          </div>
          <p class="col-xs-12"> Our final deliverables to the client included a branding guidelines book and a requirements book. The requirements book includes a site map, data dictionary, and detailed outlines of all use cases along with correlating UI pages. The aim of the requirements book is that designs can be clearly and effectively communicated to product and web development teams. Each use case includes preconditions and postconditions to mitigate confusion and miscommunication and can be easily converted to engineering agile sprint stories. <a class="click-me-link" href="img/livcollege/requirements_package.pdf" target="_blank"> View the full requirements package.</a></p>
