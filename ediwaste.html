          <h1> Edinburgh Waste Management </h1>
          <p> The Edinburgh City Council was concerned about the waste management and fly tipping problems in the city. Field research in the areas Gorgie Street and Leith Walk.  We interviewed children and adults and filled out journey maps from when they eat food or throw something away up until they dispose of the trash in a bin,  conducted an online survey and reviewed the existing app and data sets the Edinburgh city council had. We then created personas and highlighted pain points. We then brainstormed initial ideas and began prototyping and conducting interviews to gain feedback on these ideas. </p>

            <p> After the fast hackathon, we used data driven design for a household bin prototype based on existing city data. This was then placed in the home of a family of four. Sensors in the bins and interviews conducted with family members helped us gain further insights and improvements for the design. Such insights included adding covers to the landfill bins to reduce smell and increasing the size of the mixed recycling bin. We also found that there is a lot of confusion on the color scheme, and conducted more surveys and interviews with school children and adults to report to the council.</p>

          <p> A paper prototype of a gamification app tested as well in which all family members competed against each other on who could recycle the most. The winner got to open a mysterious envelope that contained the prize. While we wanted the game to be communal so households could compete against one another, for the test we had the family members compete against each other in a household.

          <p> While this was a paper prototype of a mobile app, we learned that the children actually liked the tactile element of the game and donâ€™t generally carry around their phones in the house. They would rather play against family and friends, instead of neighbors. While the prize was a nice incentive for children, the biggest incentive for the parents to partake in the game was a behavioral change in their children. Based on these insights, we would modify the game for a second round of prototyping.</p>
