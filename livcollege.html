                <p class="header-about-text"> For a more personalized campus visit experience, LivCollege is a web application that pairs prospective college students with current college students that have similar interests and profiles. The B2B service works with university admissions offices, high school students, and college students to schedule and arrange campus visits and provide feedback. </p>

            <h2> The Challenge </h2>
            <p> As project lead, I managed the product by communicating directly with the client to elicit and solidify product requirements. Very early in the process, it was clear that the business requirements and business rules had not been solidified. How are hosts paid after a visit? How long are visits? What is the cancellation policy for a visit? On what criteria are prospective and current college students matched? These were some of the many questions that needed to be answered before we even started wireframing. </p>

          <div class="proj-section-right col-xs-12 col-md-5">
            <h2> The "What" </h2>
            <p>  Because these ambguities would result in gaping holes in the UX, the first major step was to sit down with the client and ask: "What does LivCollege do?" By using a simple requirement elictation exercise with a whiteboard and lots of sticky notes, we worked with the client to understand his vision, then strip down the full list of requirements only those that were needed for a minimum viable product. </p>

            <h2> Personas to Portals </h2>
            <p> While the core functionality was outlined, we also needed to think about who would use the web app. LivCollege is designed for three very different users: A prospective college student, a college student for hosting visits, and university administration. Personas were created to understand and empathasize at a deeper level. This revealed how different the motives and challenges for each type of LivCollege user would be- leading to the decision to make separate user portals for each. The interactions between the difference users made for interesting user flow challenges. </p>

            <h2> Paper Prototyping and Wireframing </h2>
            <p> We went through many rounds of paper prototyping and wireframing before we finalized the UI. Once we had solidified the use cases our client wanted in the MVP, the process was a lot smoother. The biggest challenge in this phase was designing different portals for the prospective student, host student, and University Administration. Each of these portals needed a UI design that not only reflected the use cases for that user, but also tied seamlessly for interactions with other user types. We also met with Northeastern University admissions and showed them our initial wireframes to gather feedback. By brainstorming all possible requirements and narrowing it down to the essential ones for our MVP, we were able to solidify a set of business requirements and use cases.</p>

          <h2 class="col-xs-12"> Final Requirements Package </h2>
          <p class="col-xs-12"> Our final deliverables to the client included a branding guidelines book and a requirements book. The requirements book includes a site map, data dictionary, and detailed outlines of all use cases along with correlating UI pages. The aim of the requirements book is that designs can be clearly and effectively communicated to product and web development teams. Each use case includes preconditions and postconditions to mitigate confusion and miscommunication and can be easily converted to engineering agile sprint stories. <a class="click-me-link" href="img/livcollege/requirements_package.pdf" target="_blank"> View the full requirements package.</a></p>
