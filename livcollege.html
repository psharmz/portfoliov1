          <h1> LivCollege </h1>
          <p> LivCollege is a service that pairs prospective college students with current college students for a personalized campus visit experience. I was brought on the team as project lead and got to work with four awesome designers. As a team, we elicited requirements, created a brand identity and logo, and designed a high-fidelity prototype of the web application. Working on this particular project taught me how to deal with changing requirements. Because we had three different parties: prospective student, host student, and university administrators, I also learned how to design create user experiences for applications that have multiple user types. </p>

            <h1> Paper Prototyping and Wireframing </h1>
            <p> By involving stakeholders early, we became aware that our client had not solidified a business model, hence finalizing wireframes was difficult. We dealt with this challenge by solidifying a minimal viable product in a brainstorm session with our client. By brainstorming all possible requirements and narrowing it down to the essential ones for our MVP, we were able to solidify a set of business requirements and begin translating them to use cases for our wireframes.</p>

          <p> Each use case includes preconditions and postconditions to mitigate confusion and miscommunication and can be  easily converted to agile sprint stories for devs </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h1> Final Requirements Package: </h1>
          <p> Our final deliverables to the client included a branding guidelines book and a requirements book. The requirements book includes a site map, data dictionary, and detailed outlines of all use cases along with correlating UI pages. The aim of the requirements book is that designs can be clearly and effectively communicated to product and web development teams.</p>

          <img class="ovals" src="img/livcollege/data_dictionary.png" margin="0" >
          <p>While working together to create this web app, words which were used regularly may seem foreign to others who are later brought on to help build this project. For this reason, a data dictionary was created for common words that are used throughout the requirements package. </p>

          <p>There are many objects which are constantly changing in this web application, such as booking dates, and the availability of hosts. The “state” of these objects are dependent on many conditions, which can be hard to communicate or keep track of. State diagrams were created to help mitigate the risk of bugs due to these edge cases. </p>
